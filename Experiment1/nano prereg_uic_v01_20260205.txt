UIC v0.1 — Relational Perturbation Hypothesis (RPH) Test
Preregistered: [DATE]

HYPOTHESIS:
Entangled qubits with structured informational coupling will exhibit
longer T2* coherence times (Ramsey decay constant) than isolated qubits
or entangled qubits with random noise coupling.

METRICS:
Primary: T2* (µs) from Ramsey visibility decay fits
Secondary: Mutual information I(A:B) in Z-basis at measurement time
Tertiary: Shannon entropy H(A,B) (classical proxy)

CONDITIONS (BLINDED):
Z: Calibration/noise baseline (T1 + T2* same session window)
A: Isolated qubit Ramsey (T2* baseline)
B: Bell + structured coupling (dynamic measurement + conditional feedback when supported)
C: Bell + random Pauli noise control

STATISTICAL TEST (PRIMARY):
One-way ANOVA on visibility distributions across A/B/C (α = 0.05)
Post-hoc: Tukey HSD
Effect sizes: Cohen’s d (pairwise)

FALSIFICATION:
If B ≤ A in coherence metric (T2*/visibility stability), RPH not supported.
If B ≈ C, structured coupling irrelevant (no evidence RPH structure matters).
If p > 0.05, insufficient evidence for RPH under tested protocol.

NULL RESULT INTERPRETATION:
If RPH not supported, quantum relational effects are not necessary for UIC v0.1;
focus shifts to classical integration + TSC metrics and alternative coupling definitions.
