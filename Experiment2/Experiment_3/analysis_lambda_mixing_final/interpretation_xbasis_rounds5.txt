XBASIS LAMBDA MIXING ANALYSIS (Rounds=5)
======================================================================

Model: P_mixed(λ) = (1-λ) * P_quantum + λ * P_classical

Amplitude vs λ:
  Linear fit: A(λ) = -0.7823*λ + 0.7858
  R² = 0.9999

✅ Amplitude scales linearly with (1-λ)!
   → Classical mixing suppresses coherence amplitude

T2* vs λ:
  Mean: 47.40 μs
  Std:  4.91 μs

✅ T2* is approximately constant across λ
   → Decay rate unchanged by classical mixing

======================================================================
X-BASIS INTERPRETATION:
======================================================================

This is the COHERENCE-SENSITIVE measurement!
Expected: Linear amplitude suppression, constant T2*
This proves classical mixing = coherence suppression model!
