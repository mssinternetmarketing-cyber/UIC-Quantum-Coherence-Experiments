COHERENCE SCALING MODEL RESULTS
============================================================

MODEL: V_mixed(t, lambda) = (1-lambda) * V_quantum(t)

--- T2* vs Lambda ---
slope: 0.89652 us per lambda
intercept: 5.82722 us
R^2: 0.159777

⚠️ T2* shows variation with lambda
   → May indicate fitting issues or non-exponential decay

--- Amplitude vs Lambda ---
slope: -0.470694 per lambda
intercept: 0.46989
R^2: 0.999742

✅ Amplitude scales linearly: a(lambda) ≈ (1-lambda) * a_quantum
   → Classical model = coherence suppression (as expected!)

============================================================
INTERPRETATION:
============================================================

If T2* constant + Amplitude linear:
  → Hidden variables just suppress coherence amplitude
  → Decay dynamics are unchanged (classical mixing works)

If T2* varies OR Amplitude nonlinear:
  → Quantum effects cannot be reduced to classical mixing
  → Potential Bell-type violation in time domain!
